# U.S. Web Design Standards

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/18F/web-design-standards.svg?branch=18f-pages-staging)](https://travis-ci.org/18F/web-design-standards)

The [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards) is a library of open source UI components and a visual style guide for U.S. federal government websites.

These tools follow industry-standard web accessibility guidelines and reuse the best practices of existing style libraries and modern web design. Created and maintained by [U.S. Digital Service](https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service) and [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov) designers and developers, the Web Design Standards are designed to support government product teams in creating beautiful and easy-to-use online experiences for the American people. Learn more about this project in our announcement [blog post](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/09/28/web-design-standards/).

Design files of all the assets included on this site are available for download here: [https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards-assets](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards-assets).

The structural setup of this repo is based off of [https://github.com/18F/pages](https://github.com/18F/pages).

### Reuse of open source style guides

Much of the guidance in Web Design Standards leans on open source designs, code, and patterns from other civic and government organizations, including:
- Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s [Design Manual](https://cfpb.github.io/design-manual/)
- U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s [Design Patterns](http://uspto.github.io/designpatterns/)
- Healthcare.gov [Style Guide](http://styleguide.healthcare.gov/)
- UK’s Government Digital Service’s [UI Elements](http://govuk-elements.herokuapp.com/)
- Code for America’s [Chime Styleguide](https://github.com/chimecms/chime-starter)
- Pivotal Labs [Component Library](http://styleguide.cfapps.io/)

## Getting started

To begin using the U.S. Web Design Standards, include the CSS and JavaScript files in each HTML page of your project. Copy the full `_site/assets/` directory to a relevant place in your code base `cp ./_site/assets/css/main.css /path/to/your/repo/static/dir`. Add the following `<link>` and `<script>` elements in your HTML:

- `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/your/assets/css/main.css">`
- `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/your/assets/css/google-fonts.css">`
- `<script src="/path/to/your/assets/js/components.js"></script>`

## Setup for your local environment

### Requirements

You will need [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) ( > version 2.2.3 ). You may
consider using a Ruby version manager such as
[rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) or [rvm](https://rvm.io/) to
help ensure that Ruby version upgrades don't mean all your
[gems](https://rubygems.org/) will need to be rebuilt.

On OS X, you can also use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) to install Ruby in
`/usr/local/bin`, which may require you to update your `$PATH` environment
variable. Here are the commands to follow to install via homebrew:

```shell
$ brew update
$ brew install ruby
```

### Installation

Now that you have verified that you have Ruby installed, clone and run the
following [go script](https://github.com/18F/go_script) commands to initialize and serve the library locally.

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:18F/web-design-standards.git
$ cd web-design-standards
$ ./go serve
```

You should now be able to visit `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`
and view the web design standards locally.
